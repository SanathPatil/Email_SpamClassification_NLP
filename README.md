# Email_SpamClassification_NLP
Performed data preparation involving: removing punctuations, tokenization, removing stop-words, stemming/lemmatization.  Feature Engineering- creating additional features to benefit model building. Performing data visualization- to analyse how the features are affecting the final variable. Vectorizing the data using TF-IDF Vectorizer. Finally, predicting whether an email is a spam or not using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Additionally, K-Fold Cross-Validation technique is used to evaluate the estimator performance and avoid overfitting. Also, Hyper-Parameter tuning is performed using Grid-Search on the models to optimize the results.
