# Email_SpamClassification_NLP
The tasks involved in the project are:
* Performed data preparation: 
    - removing punctuations
    - tokenization
    - removing stop-words
    - stemming/lemmatization  
 * Feature Engineering- creating additional features to benefit model building. 
 * Performing data visualization- to analyse how the features are affecting the final variable. 
 * Vectorizing the data using Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer for understanding and chosing the TF-IDF Vectorizer for model building.
 * Finally, predicting whether an email is a spam or not using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier. 
 * K-Fold Cross-Validation technique is used to evaluate the estimator performance and avoid overfitting. 
 * Hyper-Parameter tuning is performed using Grid-Search CV on the models to optimize the results.
 * It is observed that the model has a significant performance increase after tuning the Hyper parameters.
